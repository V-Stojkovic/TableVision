# TableVision


## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a proof of concept for an autonomous table official system. In the spirit of being a proof of concept we focus on the system being able to perform the following:
* Detect and act upon time-keeping signals
* Keep score during the game
* Keep track of team fouls
* Facililate human intervention


## Running TableVision

If you wish you wish to run table vision, first install the necessary requirements: this can be achieved by running
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (recommended: set up virtual environment)

From there simply run `python3 main.py`
